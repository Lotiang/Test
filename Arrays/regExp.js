// JavaScript Regular Expressions
// A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

// The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.

// What Is a Regular Expression?
// A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.

// When you search for data in a text, you can use this search pattern to describe what you are searching for.

// A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.

// Regular expressions can be used to perform all types of text search and text replace operations.

// Example
// Using String Methods
// In JavaScript, regular expressions are often used with the two string methods: search() and replace().

// The search() method uses an expression to search for a match, and returns the position of the match.

// The replace() method returns a modified string where the pattern is replaced.

// Using String search() With a String
// The search() method searches a string for a specified value and returns the position of the match:

// Example
// Use a string to do a search for "W3schools" in a string:

// let text = "Visit W3Schools!";
// let n = text.search("W3Schools");
// The result in n will be:

6
// Example explained:

// /w3schools/i  is a regular expression.

// w3schools  is a pattern (to be used in a search).

// i  is a modifier (modifies the search to be case-insensitive).
